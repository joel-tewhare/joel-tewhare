## Hi, I'm Joel 👋
I'm a full-stack software developer based in Lichfield, New Zealand.

### 😄 About Me
I have a background in digital platforms, e-commerce, and a decade of working internationally at sea.
While working in the online business space, I decided to make a move into software development, studying part-time at Dev Academy.
Through tech, I’ve continued to solve problems in creative ways, building web applications with UX-led design and well-structured backend code. I'd love to find opportunities where these elements are a part of my day-to-day tasks, and work in a supportive environment where growth and challenging yourself is encouraged.
