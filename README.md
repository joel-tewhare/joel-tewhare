## Hi, I'm Joel 👋
I'm a full-stack software developer based in Lichfield, New Zealand.

### 😄 About Me
I have a background in managing online assets for small business and spent a decade working internationally at sea. 
While working in the online business space, I often had ideas that were limited by my technical skill set. This inspired a move into software development through Dev Academy.
Through tech, I’ve continued problem-solving in creative ways and have thoughtfully planned projects while developing new interests in UX-led design
and writing well-structured backend code. My goal is to find opportunities in tech where these elements can be a part of my day-to-day tasks, in a supportive environment where growth and challenging yourself is encouraged.
